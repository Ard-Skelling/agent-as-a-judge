    "query": "Develop a system to predict drug response using the GDSC dataset with a Support Vector Machine (SVM) regressor. Load the dataset and perform feature selection to identify key features in `src/data_loader.py`. Implement the SVM regressor in `src/model.py`. Use cross-validation to evaluate the model's performance in `src/train.py`.  Save the performance results to `results/metrics/performance.txt`. Visualize the regression results using seaborn and save it under `results/figures/`. Next, create a report including the data preprocessing, model training, evaluation process, and the visualization. Save the report as `results/drug_response_prediction_report.pdf`. The report should emphasize how feature selection impacts the model's performance, and the regression results visualization should clearly highlight the relationship between the selected features and the predicted drug response. Ensure the system is designed to be easily extendable for incorporating additional datasets or new features.",
